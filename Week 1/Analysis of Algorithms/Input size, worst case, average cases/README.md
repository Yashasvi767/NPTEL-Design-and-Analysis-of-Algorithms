# Input size

- Typically a natural parameter
  - For a sorting and other problems on arrays: array size
  - For combinatorial problems: number if objects
  - For graphs, two paramenter: number if vertices and number of edges

# Orders of magnitude

- When comparing t(n) across platforms, focus on order of magnitude and ignore constants
- f(n)=n<sup>3</sup> eventually growns faster than g(n)=5000 n <sup>2</sup>
